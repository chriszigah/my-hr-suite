The GitHub repository "my-hr-suite" provides a minimal setup for a Human Resources (HR) management suite built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. This setup supports hot module replacement (HMR) and includes ESLint configuration for code quality checks. The repository includes TypeScript files, configuration files for ESLint, Tailwind, and Vite, and setup instructions to enable additional plugins for type-aware linting and styling. 

More Fetures will be added soon.
